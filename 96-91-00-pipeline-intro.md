# Automation Explainer

We rely on a lot of automation to speed up and standardize tasks. This is usually handled by Bitbucket Pipelines, which is a continuous integration (CI) service built into Bitbucket. For more information on the available pipelines, see the [Pipeline Overview](bitbucket-pipeline-overview). The actual pipeline configuration can be found [on Github](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template-development/blob/development/bitbucket-pipelines.yml).
