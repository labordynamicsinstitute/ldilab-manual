# Submitting deposit-related information via openICPSR 

## Decision point?

```{note}
If 

  - [`MCStatus`] contains `CA` and [`MCRecommendationV2`] = `Conditional Accept`, or
  - [`MCStatus`] contains `RR`

then proceed to [Request revisions](request-revisions).

Otherwise, if  [`MCStatus`] contains `CA` and [`MCRecommendationV2`] = `Accept` or `Accept with changes`
then proceed to [Preparing Deposit for Publication](preparing-deposit-for-publication).
```

(request-revisions)=
## Request revisions

In principle, once the report is uploaded, the author will get the report with the requested revisions via ScholarOne. However, under the post-August 2020 workflow on openICPSR, the project may need to be unlocked for the author to make changes.
To do so, proceed as follows:

1. Open the issue on Jira.
2. If the issue is still in `Submitted to MC`, then choose `Post message to openICPSR` transition, which will pop up with fields displayed. Wait here.
3. Right-click on the [`Replication package URL`] field to open the openICPSR deposit.
4. On openICPSR, 
   - verify what the openICPSR `Deposit Status` is (top right corner) ![Deposit in Progress image](images/change-status-button.png).
   - if  `Deposit Status` = *`Deposit in Progress`*, you are done on openICPSR. Go back to the Jira issue
   - if `Deposit Status` = *`Submitted`*, then
      - click on `Change Status`, choose `Request revisions`
  - in the pop-up, paste and submit the following lines: 


```{admonition}  We call this 
the **"Request-revisions-RR" message**.

```

Use this template if the paper is in [`RR`] :

```
Revisions requested. Details in the full report, which you will receive via ScholarOne
or from the editor in charge of the paper.

> [NOTE] Replication packages may be published as soon as all requested changes to the deposit have been made. Please process any requested changes as soon as possible.
```

Use this template if the paper is in [`CA`] :

```
Revisions requested. Details in the full report, which you will receive via ScholarOne
in a few business days.

> [NOTE] We may publish replication packages as soon as all requested changes
to the deposit have been made. Please process any requested changes as soon
as possible.
```

4. Back in the Jira issue, continue to transition the issue to `Done`.
