# Julia-related procedures

In this section, we will show you a few things related specifically to running code reproducibly with Julia. For more general debugging tips for Julia and other computer languages, see [our wiki](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/replicability-training/wiki/Julia-Tips).

## Managing multiple Julia versions

Julia has a native version manager. Follow instructions at [https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) to install it - it will be installed in your personal directory (so is not shared). Then, to add a particular Julia version,

```
juliaup add 1.9.2
juliaup default 1.9.2
```

and your next call to Julia will launch 1.9.2. 

## Julia is picky about how environments are passed to workers

```
julia --project=julia16 -p 4
```
should start with the project installed in `julia16` and 4 worker processes. In fact, the worker processes ignore the project packages, and the whole thing fails (see [this link](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/28781)).

Workaround:

```
export JULIA_PROJECT=julia16
julia -p 4
```
seems to work.

## Importing someone else's Julia environment

An author using Julia may have included Project.toml and/or Manifest.toml, which specify Julia version and dependencies. To activate this environment:

```
julia --project=project/path -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
```
where project/path contains Project.toml and Manifest.toml. (more information [here](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/)).
