## What are EPS files?

Some authors have the code write out `.eps` files. These are "[Encapsulated PostScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulated_PostScript)" files. In principle, Adobe Acrobat should be able to conver them, but they cannot be included in the `REPLICATION.md` file, nor can they easily be viewed.

Since October 2024, we have a pipeline script that can help you. 

- First, be sure to `git add` all EPS files, then `git commit` them, followed by `git push`.
- Go to the `Pipeline` tab in Bitbucket for your repository, and 
	- choose the `6-convert-eps-pdf` pipeline. 
	- enter the `openICPSRID` that is being used (this field can also handle a deeper directory, such as `openICPSRID/replication_package`, but you will rarely need to use this).
	- by default, the pipeline will only convert `.eps` to `.png`, but you can also select `yes` in the `ProcessPDF` field if you need PDF files.

This will convert all `.eps` files, and create `.png` files in the same directory. You should then `git pull` in your local workspace to get the files.

## File too big - rejection by Bitbucket

Bitbucket imposes a 100MB limit for files being pushed to the Git repo. This is similar to other Git services.

::::{admonition} Do not try to override this!
:class: warning

While in some cases, the right solution may be to use something like [Git LFS](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/manage-large-files-with-git-large-file-storage-lfs/), we do not need to use that here, except in very rare cases.

::::

### If the commit has not been pushed yet

First, find the file:

```bash
find /path/to/search -type f -size +100M
```

Then, remove the file from the repository, and then "amend" the previous commit. This assumes that the immediately preceding commit is the offending one. Adjust if not.

```bash
git rm --cached path/to/VERYLARGEFILE
git commit --amend
```

### If the commit has been pushed

If the commit has been pushed, you will need to rewrite the history. This is a bit more complicated, but it can be done. The following steps will rewrite the history of the last 3 commits.

```bash
git rm --cached path/to/VERYLARGEFILE
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

This will open an editor with the last 3 commits. Change the word `pick` to `squash` for the commits between when the large file was added, and when it was removed. Save and close the editor. You will then be prompted to edit the commit message. Save and close the editor. This will solve it on your local machine. You will then need to force push to the remote repository.

```bash
git push origin master --force
```

### File too big in history of repository

If there are various files scattered throughout the history of the repository, you will need to use a tool called `bfg-repo-cleaner`. This is a more advanced tool, and you should be careful when using it. It is not recommended to use this tool unless you are very comfortable with Git.

- [Instructions to migrate to LFS](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/use-bfg-to-migrate-a-repo-to-git-lfs/)

However, we do not want to migrate to LFS, rather, we want to delete the big files. See the command line option `-D` to `bfg`. 

:::{warning}

Danger! Do not proceed unless you **really** understand what you are doing!

Sample session:

```bash
# In the original cloned repository for aearep-xxxx
xxxx=4406
git rm data/path/to/VERYLARGEFILE
git commit -m 'Removing big files' -a
git push
cd ..
# The "--bare" is very important here!
git clone --bare git@bitbucket.org:aeaverification/aearep-${xxxx}.git
# remove all rds files
java -jar bfg-1.14.0.jar -D "*.rds" aearep-${xxxx}.git/
# remove files based on size
java -jar bfg-1.14.0.jar --strip-blobs-bigger-than 50M aearep-${xxxx}.git/
# The report will detail what was removed
cd aearep-${xxxx}.git
git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive
git push origin master --force
```

After cleaning, if the repository size is still too big, then it may be necessary to

- delete the repository completely on Bitbucket
- create a new (empty) repository on Bitbucket
- redo `git push origin master --force`
