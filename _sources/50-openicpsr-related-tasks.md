# AEA: Interfacing with repositories

:::{note}

The AEA uses openICPSR  as its primary data and code repository. However, other acceptable repositories include [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/aeajournals/), [Codeocean](https://codeocean.com/explore), and others. 

:::

In addition to the various tasks already described on openICPSR (here, [here](using-pre-pub-openicpsr), and [here](submitting-info-via-openicpsr)), some other tasks may sometimes need to be done on the platform. This section describes those tasks.
