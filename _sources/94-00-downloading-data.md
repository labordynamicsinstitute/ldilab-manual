# Downloading Data

Most data we receive comes from pre-publication openICPSR deposits. However, they may sometimes be privately provided and are then stored on a secure shared drive, or they may come from other trusted repositories (e.g., Zenodo, Dataverse), as well as restricted data.

Sometimes, when we process data on [BioHPC](linux-remote), it may be more convenient to download the data to [CCSS Cloud](windows-remote), and then transfer to BioHPC. See [Globus transfers](globus-transfers) (this chapter) for more information. The use of `sftp` is another option.
