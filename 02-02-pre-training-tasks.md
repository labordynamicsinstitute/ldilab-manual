# Pre-training tasks {#pre-training}

We ask that trainees accomplish a few tasks prior to the first training session. Please do the following:

## Read

- We frequently meet virtually - at least one, and most of the time both of our weekly meetings are on Zoom. Review our [Video Etiquette rules](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/replicability-training/wiki/Videoconferencing-Rules-and-Etiquette) (they are useful beyond our group as well). When training is virtual, these rules apply as well.
- Review our [Privacy Policy](#privacy), where you will recognize how we handle your privacy, and the privacy of authors. 

## View

- View [my talk on the background of the lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj-y3dLDOEA), including what we do, and why we do it.
